## Here's the Problem Statement:

Sudoku is one of the most popular classic games. The playing grid of sudoku consists of the 9*9 squares space. The game initially has 9 squares combining rows and columns. Out of these 9 squares, every square is a separate grid of 3*3 square spaces. Every row and column consist of 9 squares. It can be either one player or a two-player game where the competitors try to fill the boxes faster than their opponents. The game’s primary purpose is to fill boxes in every square with numbers ranging from 1 to 9. The exciting thing about the Sudoku game is that no column, row, or square allows repeating a number.
Moreover, the game initially fills some of the squares with random numbers from 1 to 9. The rest of the boxes or squares are left empty for the player to fill. The number of already filled boxes determines the complexity of the game.
